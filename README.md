# A Basic Stable IDE config for Neovim

> Why does this repo exist?

This config attempts to provide a rock solid fully featured starting point for someone new to Neovim, or just tired of maintaining the basic IDE components of their config. 

> What makes it "rock solid"?

All of the included plugins are pinned to a version that ensures they are compatible and will not update potentially introducing errors into your config. For every Neovim release I will update this repo along with the community to keep it up to date with the newest versions.

As I mentioned, this config is meant as a starting point for people new to Neovim who want a familiar IDE experience. The config has a very simple structure that makes it easy to add new plugins. 

## Install Neovim 0.7

You can install Neovim with your package manager e.g. brew, apt, pacman etc.. but remember that when you update your packages Neovim may be upgraded to a newer version.

If you would like to make sure Neovim only updates when you want it to than I recommend installing from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
cd neovim
git checkout release-0.7
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make install
```

## Install the config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/imekinox/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```sh
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```sh
  npm i -g neovim
  ```

**NOTE** make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, I recommend a node manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
